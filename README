============================================================================

This library is obsolete. Please use the official gcc C++ standard library.

============================================================================

uSTL is a partial implementation of the C++ standard library that focuses on
decreasing the memory footprint of user executables. While many projects can
use it to replace the standard library without any code changes, there exist
important differences that you should be aware of. Please read documentation
in docs/index.html (or online at https://msharov.github.io/ustl) before using
this library in your project.

The only dependency is a C++ compiler, gcc 3.4 or clang 3.2. C++11 support
requires gcc 4.6 or clang 3.2. C++14 support requires gcc 5 or clang 3.6.
clang does not optimize for size as well as gcc, producing binaries larger
by about 15%, so its use is not recommended.
